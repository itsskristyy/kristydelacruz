            <h1> Hello, My name is Kristy Delacruz and I am a software engineer at Wells Fargo. </h1>

            <p> Hi, I'm Kristy De La Cruz, a Software Engineer at Wells Fargo with a focus on building accessible, user-friendly web applications using React and JavaScript.
                I enjoy collaborating across design and engineering teams to create clean, responsive interfaces that make a difference in people's day-to-day experience.
                I'm currently expanding my backend skills by learning Java and Spring Boot while building full-stack projects that combine both.
                Originally from New York and now based in Charlotte, I love capturing scenic views, discovering new coffee spots, and spending time outdoors with my partner.
                I'm always excited to connect and collaborate on projects that challenge me to grow as a developer.</p>
